### 🎮 How It Works

1. **Select a Category**  
   Choose from various themes like:  
   🐾 Animals | 🌸 Flowers | 🎵 Musical Instruments ...and more.

2. **Memorize the Cards**  
   You get **10 seconds** to memorize the layout of images.

3. **Guess the Positions**  
   One image is shown — pick the correct location from memory.  
   💡 Hover over any card to see a **description** of the image.

4. **Difficulty Increases Over Time**  
   The number of cards grows each round (3 → 4 → 5...)  
   ⏱️ Time remains fixed — only **10 seconds** to memorize!

5. **Dynamic Content from API**  
   Images are fetched **randomly** from an external API — every game feels fresh.

6. **Sound effects 🎶 **
